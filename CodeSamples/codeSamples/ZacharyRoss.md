' i have decided to go over the die.java file which creats a die that has anywhere from 1 to N sides but defaults to 6 sides. This class lays out rules that basically say the die has to have alteast 1 side and atleast 1 result && the number of sides has to be greater or equal to the result. for example you couldnt have a die that had 3 results but 2 sides otherwise the class prints an error that says it violates a precondition. only thing I am having trouble understanding here is the boolean method that is comparing the result which is an iteger and "otherObj" which is an Object. why not just compare another int? Then there is a line of code that basicaly prints the number of sides and the results.'
